## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Codewars has challenged for many languages, but I'm using it for JavaScript.

## Optimizations
Only improvement here is to getting to a higher kata level!

## Lessons Learned:

I highly recommend Codewars as an invaluable resource for developers. Unlike Anki, it focuses more on problem-solving rather than memorization. Regardless of your experience level, Codewars offers challenges that promote continuous learning, reflecting the true essence of being an engineer. Personally, by practicing Codewars daily, I have gained immense confidence in utilizing various methods for manipulating strings, arrays, and objects. I intend to continue this routine as I advance in my engineering career with unwavering determination and zeal.
